      title: 'Railway Oriented Programming, Getting Us Back On Track'
      description: |-
        <p>
          Your Rails applications are probably missing one crucial component: Operation classes that
          harness the power of Railway Oriented Programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          While "The Rails Way" gave us incredible productivity wins with convention over
          configuration and rapid prototyping, it left a gap in handling complex business logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your controllers are doing their job of handling requests & responses, your models are
          doing theirs by representing data, but how are you isolating your business logic to make
          it easier to use in isolation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Railway Oriented Programming fills this void with Operation classes that make success and
          failure paths explicit and composable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll show you how to use this pattern in a Rails application, writing practical examples
          of how to use operations to transform messy, scattered business logic into elegant,
          composable workflows.

      title: '10 things I hate about Ruby'
      description: >-
        <p>
          We often celebrate Ruby for its "magic" and developer-friendly syntax, but what happens
          when that magic becomes mystifying? Drawing on a programming journey through a wide
          spectrum of languages, from low-level bit-twiddling to the highest levels of Lisp, this
          talk explores why Ruby is one of the most deceptively difficult languages to master.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll move beyond the surface-level shine to dissect specific inconsistencies and design
          deficiencies that make building a coherent mental model a surprising challenge. A critical
          and affectionate look at the language we love, designed to spark a deeper conversation
          about its quirks and complexities.

      title: 'TDD - why does it fail?'
      description: A bunch of us Ruby devs write tests because "we are told to". We write tests because its meant to be a good things. We follow philosophies like betterspecs.org because it sounded like a good idea at the time. This presentation takes us back to "why" write tests and "why" looking at each test failure, should be the driver of the design of your code. It also introduces the philosophy of evenbetterspecs as well as why DAMP (Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases) tests are preferable over DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
        This talk will leave you with a bunch of tools, tips and philosophies to get more out of your tests and their readability no matter what language you code in. Code repo https://github.com/failure-driven/tdd-why-does-it-fail
