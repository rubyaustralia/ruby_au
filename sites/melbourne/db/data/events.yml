      title: 'TDD - why does it fail?'
      description: A bunch of us Ruby devs write tests because "we are told to". We write tests because its meant to be a good things. We follow philosophies like betterspecs.org because it sounded like a good idea at the time. This presentation takes us back to "why" write tests and "why" looking at each test failure, should be the driver of the design of your code. It also introduces the philosophy of evenbetterspecs as well as why DAMP (Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases) tests are preferable over DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
        This talk will leave you with a bunch of tools, tips and philosophies to get more out of your tests and their readability no matter what language you code in. Code repo https://github.com/failure-driven/tdd-why-does-it-fail
