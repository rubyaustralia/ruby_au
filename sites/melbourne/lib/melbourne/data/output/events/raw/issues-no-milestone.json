Many will argue that these knowledge is uselees and not really required to `center a <div>`. However, it seems to be a 'secret' handshake you need to learn if you want to apply to a corporate company and be successfull at your dream job at FacePalm, Hooli, etc [aligning buttons and doing colour animations](https://www.twitch.tv/j_blow/clip/UninterestedAuspiciousPizzaFreakinStinkin-4Urg8_phIw1jbHme).\r\nI will present my takeaways and tips how to quickly estimate it. (I used [ThePrrimeagen's Aglorithm Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms))\r\n\r\n- BigO what it is; Time and Space; O(1), O(n), logn, n logn, n^2, n!, etc\r\n- how to roughly estimate it\r\n- examples of different algorithms and BigO estimation\r\n\r\n__Timing:__ tbc\r\n\r\n>    Are you happy to have your talk published on the RubyAU YouTube channel? -> yes\r\n    Your Twitter username (if you have one) -> [@friendlyantz](https://twitter.com/friendlyantz)\r\n    Link to, or upload of, a photo of yourself that will appear in the meetup slide deck: refer https://github.com/rubyaustralia/melbourne-ruby/issues/192\r\n\r\n(can be 10-15mins or as long as 30mins)",

    "description": "As a number of recent high profile breaches have demonstrated, a lot of our deeply personal information is regularly getting compromised.  Encrypting data is an extremely effective way of protecting that data, but it's still not a universal practice.  It's easy to assume that it's just overworked developers or myopic management, but there are some real challenges to encrypting data that doom many applications to have to store their data in plain text, when they'd really prefer not to.\r\n\r\nI'll talk about data encryption and why it's not as widely used as it really should be, and a new open source project I've started to address some of the challenges of usable data encryption, which happens to have an ActiveRecord plugin as its first public client.\r\n\r\nFormat: I can pare it down to 15 minutes if necessary, but 30-45 minutes gives me a chance to really get the message across.  With more time I can give the pure Rubyists a thrill, too, with more of a deep dive into the underlying technology (such as the joys of tying Ruby and Rust together).\r\n\r\nAvailability: I can't make it to meetups in the school holidays, so either this coming meetup (Nov) or it'll have to push out to Feb (or later).",
