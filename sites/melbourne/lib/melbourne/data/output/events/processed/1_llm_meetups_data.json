        "description": "### Description(this will appear on youtube):\nCode doesn‚Äôt just tell computers what to do‚Äîit tells future developers what you meant. In this talk, we‚Äôll explore how a simple change in a Ruby on Rails app‚Äîreplacing `image_tag` with `vite_image_tag`‚Äîunintentionally broke a core abstraction, causing a baffling `JSON::NestingError`.\n\nThis bug wasn‚Äôt just about tools like Vite or Active Storage‚Äîit was a symptom of a deeper problem: intent wasn‚Äôt communicated clearly in the code.\n\nWe‚Äôll explore the idea of unspoken contracts in software‚Äîthose invisible lines where systems, assumptions, and mental models meet. Through real-world examples, you‚Äôll learn how to:\n\n- Recognise where intent gets lost in translation\n- Communicate purpose through naming, structure, and boundaries\n- Leave better breadcrumbs for your teammates and future self\n\nWhether you're refactoring, reviewing, or just trying to be less confusing, this talk will help you write code that speaks more clearly‚Äîeven when you're not there to explain it.\n\n### Estimated Talk Time:\n30 minutes\n\n### Prefered Month to Present:\nJune 2025\n\n### Preferred Social media handles:\nGitHub: HashNotAdam\nLinkedIn: HashNotAdam\n\n### Mugshot (will be use in the slides):\nSame as from our host slides",

Against conventional wisdom, we're rebuilding it from the ground up with an aggressive timeline. The underlying model is outdated, slow to iterate on, and not extensible. The monoliths are riddled with tech debt, tightly coupled, patched and band-aided over many times, and won't scale to the $3b global Performance market we're targeting.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't challenging enough already so I'm also using this opportunity to rebuild our engineering culture. Setting a high bar for engineering standards, ways of working, and hoping to improve engagement as we go.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll share:\r\n\r\n- How I came to this decision\r\n- How we got buy in from Exec and the Board for a purely technical rebuild\r\n- How we tried to set up for success, our principles and standards\r\n- Where we failed\r\n- Where we succeeded\r\n- Lessons that could be useful for anyone thinking about rebuilding a product that's hampering speed and hindering your ability to innovate or deliver value to your customers.\r\n\r\nThe rebuild is still in progress. I don't have all the answers (or any!).

This provides valuable data that can help you check that you've approved every server that you expect to be able to send on your behalf and reduce the number of legitimate emails that are sent to spam. Unfortunately, these reports come as XML files which are usually GZipped which makes them poorly suited to human reading. Also, since they are sent by the receiving servers, you can expect to be sent many reports per day.\r\n\r\nThis talk is the story of how I leveraged Action Mailbox in Ruby on Rails to automatically parse incoming DMARC reports and alert me to issues in a human-readable format.",

        "description": "A lightning talk 5 - 10 minutes on managing environment variables in rails.\r\n\r\n> You're app is coming along and all of a sudden you need to configure the number of workers, or an endpoint to access an API. You reach for `CONSTANTS` but very quickly you find out that these will vary between **development**, **test** and **production** apps. Not only that but you have a number of **\"production\"** apps like _staging_, _sandbox_, _UAT_ and the like. You also read up about [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) and you go for **Environment Variables** (`ENV_VARS`) to configure everything. But development becomes a night mare so you use `.env` files to store all these configurations. And then you get an API **Key üîë** or **Secret üîê** and you also through it into the `.env` file and even commit it to Git!!! üö® - at night you here yourself counselling yourself\r\n>    \"it's OK, it's a private repo\"\r\n>    \"it's OK, it's only a developer secret\"\r\n\r\nIt's **NOT OK** this is the kind of behaviour that leads to security breaches and people being fired! - let's not blame the individuals but the process. The process of not having an easy way to store and share secrets is the root of the problem, and not developers accidentally sharing secrets they haphazardly saved to their publicly visible `.Dotfiles` git hub repo\r\n\r\nLearn:\r\n1. why to use Env Vars\r\n2. how to use `.env` https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv and why it's a bad idea\r\n3. how to use **rails credentials** as well as Shopify's EJson, or Mozillas SOPS or Ansible's Vault\r\n4. how to easily manage and override credentials using Evil Martians AnywayConfg\r\n5. and why you should never be complacent with the way things are - learn how to break your system to make a better system\r\n\r\nwith code examples - https://github.com/failure-driven/env-var-demo",

        "description": "Description (this will appear on YouTube): \r\n\r\nThe project of interoperability in healthcare is one that would make healthcare workers' jobs easier, our healthcare industry more efficient, and improve our experiences as patients. Yet, in spite of these upsides, the project has been held back by technical difficulty, a lack of cooperation and misaligned incentives. \r\n\r\nOne of the most promising developments in this space is HL7's FHIR standard, an extensible meta-model for exchanging healthcare data. Not only does FHIR offer some novel and fascinating techniques for flexibly modelling a wide range of data, it also engages in the community-building required to help it solve real problems, and the advocacy which is seeing it gain acceptance and mandate in national and international politics.\r\n\r\nThis talk will examine how Ruby developers can make productive use of FHIR in their projects, by describing the design of FHIR and the state of the tooling available to the Ruby ecosystem. Also discussed will be the lessons we can learn from FHIR on community-building and advocacy for our own technology solutions.\r\n\r\nEstimated Talk Time: 20 minutes\r\n\r\nPreferred Month to Present: July '23\r\n\r\nPreferred Social Media Handles: matthood0@gmail.com\r\n\r\nMugshot (will be used in the slides):\r\n![mattbio](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/melbourne-ruby/assets/1885706/ebc7dec6-6fb4-4042-968e-b860ed8ef3f7)\r\n",

        "description": "Hello organisers! I would like to propose a talk about technical writing. You can see the slide deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1somOY_01ZRgSxuAIX-RenImp9QkgytjpXwsKm91lYoo/edit?usp=sharing) if you'd like to suss it out more, but here's the gist. I can be available any Wednesday but need at least a few days' advance notice to let my D&D group know I won't be there :)\r\n\r\n## Talk Title\r\n\r\nThe Joy of Docs: Technical Writing for Developers and Engineers\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I discuss communication, specifically technical writing, why it's important, and how to improve your skills. Emphasis is on identifying and empathising with your audience. The talk does not strictly cover the writing process as it is taught in schools, but rather focusses on orienting oneself towards readers' needs when writing technical documents or producing other technical writing. The information in this talk is applicable to any kind of technical writing, from commit messages to requests for comment (RFCs), as well as technical writing that is not strictly a part of a technical document (e.g., writing in an email to stakeholders about the status of development on a project). \r\n\r\n## Why It's Important\r\n\r\nBad technical writing is a huge waste of time. Every developer who's worked in the industry for any length of time has encountered vague and unhelpful documentation and seen how much time they spend trying to find information that should've been in the docs in the first place. Engineers who read RFCs and other longer-form documents may notice these documents often don't give adequate context or define terms, leading to more time spent on research rather than focussing on the tasks at hand.",
