      "title": "Requested talk: How on earth do you manage forms with Turbo?",
      "description": "Turbo is an amazing tool that usually stays out of the way. Forms, however, come with some weird and wonderful quirks that can drive you insane.\n\nI'd love to hear a talk that covers things like:\n\n- Handling errors\n  - Status codes\n  - Double rendering\n- Redirecting after a form submission (esp when used inside a Turbo Frame)\n- Disabling Turbo on a form\n- Leveraging Turbo Streams\n- Inline validations and dynamic error messaging\n- Testing Turbo interactions",
      "comments": [
        {
          "github_username": "MattHood",
          "body": "This is close to my heart, and I'm keen to do another RORO talk, so I'd love to pick this one up.\n\nIf anyone else is keen to get into this topic, feel free to get in touch - would be lovely to have a collaborator :)"
        },
        {
          "github_username": "HashNotAdam",
          "body": "This would make me very happy, @MattHood ü´∂"
        },
        {

      "comments": [
        {
          "github_username": "HashNotAdam",
          "body": "Can't believe I didn't think to add this as a requested talk. SQLite is so hot right now! Brilliant topic"
        },
        {
          "github_username": "simonhildebrandt",
          "body": "When do you think we should do it?"
        },
        {
          "github_username": "simran-sawhney",
          "body": "Hey @simonhildebrandt we can do this May if you like ? "
        },
        {
          "github_username": "simonhildebrandt",
          "body": "Sure - I'm in no rush if we wanna give other people a go, though. üòÅ "
        },
        {
          "github_username": "dkam",
          "body": "I‚Äôm happy to do this for May, if Simon‚Äôs ok with that? I‚Äôd be aiming for a regular length talk rather than a lightning talk though. "
        },
        {
          "github_username": "simonhildebrandt",
          "body": "That'd be awesome, @dkam !\n"
        },
        {
          "github_username": "simran-sawhney",
          "body": "Hey @dkam, are you planning to go for this one this month? \nSince we don‚Äôt have much lined up, I guess we could go for a proper talk instead lightning talk!\n\n"
        },
        {
          "github_username": "simran-sawhney",
          "body": "Thanks @dkam for the amazing talk :) "
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Your task is to:
- Read all the data provided
- From the description and the comments:
  - figure out who the speaker or speakers were for a given talk and remember their name
  - figure out any social media handles they might have provided and remember them
  - figure out if they provided a link to their webiste and remember it
    - make sure that the url is for something that resembles a personal webiste. if it is a linkedin url, instagram url, twitter/x url, bluesky url or a mastodon url, extract the handle from it and remember it as a social media handle.
  - create a short summary (no longer than 300 characters) of what a meetup talk will be about. Make it slightly cheerful and inviting; as if you were inviting people to see the talk live.
  - create a slug to represent the web page the event will live on and remember it. Keep it under 70 characters
  - create a name for the event. Keep it around 60 characters. Make sure to include the topics and the speakers.

You should then use that information you've extracted to return a new JSON file. This is an example of the expected output from the sample above

```json

  "date": "2025-05-29",
  "name": "Forms and Turbo with Matt Hood and SQLite in Rails with Simon Hildebrandt",

      "speakers": [
        {
          "name": "Matt Hood",
          "contact_details": {

        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "SQLite-ruby - a whole SQL database in a gem",
      "description": "SQLite - the most deployed database that most people have never heard of - as a gem",
