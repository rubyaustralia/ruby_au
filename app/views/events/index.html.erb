      <p>
        To meet up with other Rubyists and Ruby-curious folks in person, you could perhaps attend our yearly
        <%= link_to "RubyConf AU", "https://rubyconf.org.au", class: "white-link" %> conference, or our
        <%= link_to "Ruby Retreat", "https://rails.camp", class: "white-link" %> (formally known as Rails Camp)
        social coding weekends, and our more regular meetings for talks and coding across the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many cities and regions around Australia have regular meetings, often featuring presentations on a
        variety of Ruby and industry related topics, and providing opportunities to socialise with other Rubyists.
