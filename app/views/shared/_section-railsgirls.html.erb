          Rails Girls Australia is voluntarily run by Rubyists and Ruby-curious people who want to help others learn how to
          build web applications using Ruby on Rails. Ruby Australia provides support in the form of funding, sponsorship and
          mentoring to help run these events.

          The first event, held in Helsinki in November 2010, got over 100 interested girls signed-up for the workshop.
          Since then the free events have expanded to Shanghai, Singapore, Tallinn, Berlin, Krakow and many more attracting
          thousands of girls to the world of web building with Ruby on Rails.
