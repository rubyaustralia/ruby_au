        The Mentored Contributions Program is a new Ruby Australia initiative connecting
        enthusiastic community members with experienced Rubyists.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's designed to help new contributors gain open-source experience while keeping our
        community projects active, welcoming, and well-maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're currently running the program as a <b>trial</b>, focused on learning what works best
        before expanding it more broadly. During this phase, we're keeping administration light,
        staying flexible, and gathering feedback from both mentors and mentees as we go.
      </p>

      <h2>🎯 Program Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Help new and emerging (and re-emerging) developers make meaningful open-source
          contributions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offer light, structured mentoring opportunities for experienced Rubyists.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build a sustainable pipeline of future Ruby Australia volunteers and maintainers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🧩 How It Works</h2>

      <h3>1. Register</h3>
      <p>
        Start by filling out the
        <%= link_to "Mentored Contributions registration form", volunteer_form_url %>.
        You can register as a <b>mentee</b> (new contributor) or <b>mentor</b>
        (experienced Rubyist).
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll get in touch through <%= link_to "Slack", "/slack" %> to help you find a good starting
        point.
      </p>


      <hr class="border-gray-200 my-4 sm:my-6">


      <h3>2. Contribute</h3>
      <p>
        Mentees work on real issues from
        <%= link_to "Ruby Australia projects",
                    "https://github.com/orgs/rubyaustralia/projects/14" %>,
        supported by their mentors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each mentee aims to complete four tasks per month (about one per week).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most tasks count as one credit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Larger or ongoing tasks may count for more.
        </li>
        <li>
          The number of credits can be adjusted based on experience level.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you're unsure what to work on, your mentor or a coordinator can help you pick something
        suitable.
      </p>


      <hr class="border-gray-200 my-4 sm:my-6">


      <h3>3. Mentoring Support</h3>
      <p>
        Mentors offer around <strong>1 hour of support per month</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        That time can be used however it's most useful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Talking through blockers on your current task
        </li>
        <li>
          Reviewing pull requests
        </li>
        <li>
          Discussing open-source workflows or Ruby projects
        </li>
        <li>
          Exploring next steps for your learning
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Mentors guide&mdash;they don't do the work&mdash;but they're here to help you succeed.
      </p>


      <hr class="border-gray-200 my-4 sm:my-6">


      <h3>4. Tracking and Credits</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">
        To keep the trial lightweight:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mentees self-report completed tasks each month using a short form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Credits are tracked in a shared spreadsheet by the program coordinator.
        </li>
        <li>
          No one needs to log hours &mdash; we trust participants to be honest and communicative.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After the trial, we'll review whether the credit model needs refinement before making it
        permanent.
      </p>


      <hr class="border-gray-200 my-4 sm:my-6">


      <h3>5. Recognition</h3>
      <p>
        When your work is merged, we love celebrating contributors in the
        <%= link_to "Ruby AU Slack", "/slack" %> and on social channels
        &mdash; <em>only if you'd like us to</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, mentors will be acknowledged publicly as part of the program
        &mdash; <em>only if they want to be</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every contribution, big or small, is valued equally.
      </p>
