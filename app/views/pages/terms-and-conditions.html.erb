          By law, members are entitled to inspect the member registry upon request. The purpose of this is to empower the membership to coordinate with each other irrespective of the committee. We expect this to be a very rare occurrence, with plenty of avenues for communication between members outside of this allowance. Nonetheless, there are circumstances where we are obligated to share your name and email with other members, and we suggest you choose your signup email with this in mind.
