    <h2>Meeting in Person</h2>

    <p>
      To meet up with other Rubyists and Ruby-curious folks in person, you could perhaps attend our yearly <%= link_to_external "RubyConf AU", "https://rubyconf.org.au" %> conference, our twice-yearly <%= link_to_external "Rails Camp", "https://rails.camp" %> social coding weekends, or our more <a href="#events">regular meetings</a> for talks and coding across the country.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many cities and regions around Australia have regular meetings, often featuring presentations on a variety of Ruby and industry-related topics, and providing opportunities to socialise with other Rubyists.

    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
      Ruby Australia was set up as an organisation in 2011 to support the community and events around Australia focused on the Ruby programming language. All of our events are run with our <%= link_to "Code of Conduct", page_path("code-of-conduct") %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our committee members are elected at our general meetings that occur twice a year, and they help with advising and supporting the logistics of our events and community spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are very grateful to <%= link_to "our sponsors", "/sponsorship" %> for their ongoing support to help make our events more affordable and accessible to a broader array of people across Australia.
