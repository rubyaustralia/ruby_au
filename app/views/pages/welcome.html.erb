          Ruby Australia is the premier organisation supporting the vibrant <%= link_to "Ruby", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/", class: "red-link" %>

        <p>
          Ruby is renowned for its elegant syntax and developer friendly approach - a language designed with programmer
          productivity and satisfaction at its core. Whether you're an experienced Ruby developer, just beginning your
          coding journey, or curious about what Ruby has to offer, our community welcomes you.
        </p>

        <p>
          We organise and support numerous events throughout Australia, including conferences, workshops, and meetups,
          all governed by our comprehensive <%= link_to "Code of Conduct", page_path("code-of-conduct"), class: "red-link" %> to ensure an
          inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.
        </p>

          Our dedicated <%= link_to 'committee members', "/committee-members", class: "red-link" %>, elected annually at general meetings, work diligently to advance the Ruby
          ecosystem in Australia by providing guidance and logistical support for community initiatives and events.
