  <h2>What does it mean to be a member?</h2>
</header>

<p>
  As a member, you can choose to do as much or as little as you want to, it's up to you!
</p>

<p>
  Membership gives you voting rights at general meetings and the ability to run for committee positions. We will notify you by email of upcoming general meetings and you will have the opportunity to add items to the meeting’s agenda.

  <h2>Mailing List</h2>
</header>
<p>
  If you signed up to our mailing list, you'll be notified of any upcoming major Ruby Australia events -- such as Rails Camps and RubyConf. We'll also very occassionally send updates regarding the goings on of Ruby Australia as a whole. We are committed to being light on these and you can opt-out of them at any time.

  <h2>The legals</h2>
</header>

<p>
  <small>
    The Constitution outlines how the Ruby Australia organisation runs, and covers in more detail what your rights are as a member of the Ruby Australia organisation. <a href='/files/constitution/v2.docx'>You can view the current version of the Ruby Australia Constitution here</a>.

</p>

<p>
  <small>
    By law, members are entitled to inspect the member registry upon request. The purpose of this is to empower the membership to coordinate with each other irrespective of the committee. We expect this to be a very rare occurrence, with plenty of avenues for communication between members outside of this allowance. Nonetheless, there are circumstances where we are obligated to share your name and email with other members, and we suggest you choose your signup email with this in mind.

    Ruby Australia also has a <a href='http://ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct'>Code of Conduct</a> that members are required to follow.
