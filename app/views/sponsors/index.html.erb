<p>
  The founding purpose of Ruby Australia is to further the use and adoption of the Ruby programming language in Australia, and to support and encourage a vibrant community around the language and related technologies.
</p>

<p>
  We are very lucky to have many companies who have provided sponsorship over the years to help us achieve these goals, particularly through our <a href="/#in-person">regular events</a>: RubyConf AU, Rails Camp, ongoing city meetings, and Rails Girls. Their sponsorship support combined with the massive efforts of our volunteer organisers have created world-class conferences and gatherings.
</p>
