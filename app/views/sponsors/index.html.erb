<p>
  The founding purpose of Ruby Australia is to further the use and adoption of the Ruby programming language in Australia,
  and to support and encourage a vibrant community around the language and related technologies.
</p>

<p>
  We are very lucky to have many companies who have provided sponsorship over the years to help us achieve these goals,
  particularly through our <a href="/#in-person">regular events</a>: RubyConf AU, Rails Camp, ongoing city meetups,
  and Rails Girls. Their sponsorship support combined with the massive efforts of our volunteer organisers have created
  world-class conferences and gatherings.
