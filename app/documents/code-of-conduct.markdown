# Ruby Australia's Code of Conduct

## Matz is nice, and we are nice.

In the same way that Matz has written Ruby with a focus on developer happiness, we are focused on community happiness. The Australian Ruby community is full of wonderful people from a diverse range of backgrounds, and we want to ensure it remains a welcoming and safe environment to all who wish to be a part of it.

Whenever we come together as a community, our shared spaces are opportunities to showcase the best of what we can be. We are there to support our peers - to build each other up, to accept each other for who they are, and to encourage each other to become the people they want to be.

With that in mind, if you are present at any Ruby Australia event, whether as an attendee, organiser, sponsor or speaker, or if you are active in the Ruby Australia Slack, forum, GitHub or Google group, we take it as given that you agree to follow this code of conduct.

## Purpose
A primary goal of Ruby Australia is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of (but not limited to): gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in Ruby Australia to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Expected behaviour
The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable behaviour
The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Inappropriate and/or unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualised comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances. This also includes sexualised content in talks or online discussions.
- Deliberate intimidation or stalking behaviour (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

Ruby Australia prioritises safety over comfort. Ruby Australia will not act on complaints regarding:

- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I’m not discussing this with you."
- Communicating in a "tone" you don’t find congenial.
- Consequences of unacceptable behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

Consumption of alcohol is not an excuse for unacceptable behaviour and anyone asked to stop consuming alcohol at a Ruby Australia event is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## Reporting an incident
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organiser as soon as possible.

[Reporting Guidelines](/code-of-conduct-reporting)

Additionally, community organisers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organisers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Addressing grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Ruby Australia with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies as listed in our [constitution](/constitution).

## Scope
We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues – online and in-person – as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
