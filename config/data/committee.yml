    After a few years as a park ranger and then a few more as a high school teacher, Caitlin has now made the transition into tech. She is currently an intern with Two Red Kites in Brisbane and recently started the [Brisbane Tech Newbies meet up group](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Tech-Newbies/). When she’s not coding you will probably find her watching videos of puppies on youtube and eating as many snacks as she can find.

    Late last millenium Sharon completed a computer degree because her mum, in the mid-80s, said, “There is a future in computers.” Mum may have been right but Sharon went for a wander through academia and the arts ending up as a Film Projectionist. When Sharon was replaced by a digital projector, she took irony firmly in hand and decided, in June 2016, to become a Developer. Sharon now works at Envato.

    Longtime tech enthusiast - and armed with an emoji for every occasion - Matt is a developer at [Two Red Kites](https://2rk.co). With a love of expressive language he naturally fell for Ruby. When away from the modern he can be found enjoying the traditional; small-batch coffee ☕ rear-wheel drive 🏎️ and longbow archery 🏹.
